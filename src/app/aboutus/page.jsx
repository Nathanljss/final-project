        This website was made by a few people on a coding bootcamp as their
        final project with the idea of creating a simple and straight forward
        job board website while also showing off their newly acquired coding
        skills. <br></br>This site uses Next.js and implements a Clerk user
        authenticator AND an SQL database API.
